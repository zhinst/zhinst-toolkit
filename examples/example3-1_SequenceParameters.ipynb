    "Many use cases require the freedom to define waveforms on a sample-basis. The `\"Simple\"` sequence type provided by the `zhinst-toolkit` allows for exactly that. If the *Simple* sequence is configured, the user can add waveforms to a queue of waveforms to be uploaded to the AWG Core. All the queued up waveforms will then be played in that order. The waveforms are defiend as simple `numpy` arrays, with every value in the array corresponding to one sample. Since the waveforms are defined purely by samples, the duration of the waveform depends on the *sampling rate* of the AWG Core.\n",

    "\n",
    "The parameter `period` defines the duration in seconds of one single shot of the experiment. The start of each period in the sequence is defined by a trigger signal (either the AWG sends or receives a trigger). The time origin `t=0` is the reference point for all waveform. It is defined to not coincide with the trigger signal but to be a well defined time after the trigger. This way, it is possible to shift waveforms to  *negative time* with respect to the orogin `t=0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter `dead_time` describes the the time in seconds after the time origin `t=0` before the next period begins, i.e. before the next trigger signal is sent or expected. The time origin is thus at `period - dead_time` after the trigger signal. The *dead time* is important to keep in mind because it defines the maximum length of a waveform that can be played *after* `t=0`. If the waveform is longer than *dead time*, the next trigger signal will be missed. The *dead time* defaults to *5 us*.\n",
