    The Device Settings Module provides functionality for saving and loading
    device settings to and from file. The file is saved in XML format.

    For simple save and load two helper functions exist `save_to_file` and
    `load_from_file`.

    Note:
        It is not recommend to use this function to read the
        device settings. Instead one can use the zhinst-toolkit functionality
        to read all settings from a device/subtree from the device directly by
        calling it.
