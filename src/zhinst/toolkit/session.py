class Session(Node):
    """Session to a data server.

    Zurich Instruments devices use a server-based connectivity methodology.
    Server-based means that all communication between the user and the
    instrument takes place via a computer program called a server, the data
    sever. The data sever recognizes available instruments and manages all
    communication between the instrument and the host computer on one side, and
    communication to all the connected clients on the other side. (For more
    information on the architecture please refer to the user manual
    http://docs.zhinst.com/labone_programming_manual/introduction.html)

    The entry point into for any connection is therefore a client session to a
    existing data sever. This class represents a single client session to a
    data server. The session enables the user to connect to one or multiple
    instruments (also creates the dedicated objects for each device), access
    the LabOne modules and poll data. In short it is the only object the user
    need to create by himself.

    Info:
        Except for the HF2 a single session can be used to connect to all
        devices from Zurich Instruments. Since the HF2 is historically based on
        another data server called the hf2 data server it is not possible to
        connect HF2 devices a "normal" data server and also not possible to
        connect devices apart from HF2 to the hf2 data server.

    Args:
        server_host: Host address of the data server (e.g. localhost)
        server_port: Port number of the data server. If not specified the session
            uses the default port 8004 (8005 for HF2 if specified).

            the "normal" one for all other devices. If not specified the session
            will detect the type of the data server based on the port.
            (default = None)

            not create a new session to the data server but reuse the passed
