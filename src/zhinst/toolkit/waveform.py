    """Waveform dictionary

    The key specifies the slot of the waveform on the device.
    The value is a the waveform itself, represented by a tuple
    (wave1, wave2, marker).

    The value tuple(wave1, wave2=None, marker=None) consists of the following parts:
        * wave1 (array): Array with data of waveform 1.
        * wave2 (array): Array with data of waveform 2.
        * markers (array): Array with marker data.

    A helper function exist called `assign_waveform` which provides an easy way
    of assigning waveforms to slots. But one can also use the direct dictionary
    access:

    >>> wave = 1.0 * np.ones(1008)
    >>> markers = np.zeros(1008)
    >>> waveforms = Waveforms()
    >>> waveforms.assign_waveform(0, wave)
    >>> waveforms.assign_waveform(1, wave, -wave)
    >>> waveforms.assign_waveform(2, wave, -wave, markers)
    >>> waveforms.assign_waveform(3, wave, markers=markers)
    >>> waveforms[4] = (wave,)
    >>> waveforms[5] = (wave, -wave)
    >>> waveforms[6] = (wave, -wave, markers)
    >>> waveforms[7] = (wave, None, markers)

    The arrays can be provided as arrays of interger, float. The first wave also
    can be of type complex. In that case the second waveform must be `None`.

    Depending on the target format the function `get_raw_vector` converts the
    waves into the following format:

    * native AWG waveform format (interleaved waves and markers as uint16) that
      can be uploaded to the AWG waveform nodes. In case the first wave is of
      type complex the imaginary part is treated as the second wave.
    * complex waveform format that can be uploaded to the generator waveform
      nodes (does not support markers). In case two real waveforms have been
      specified they are combined into a single complex waveform, where the
      imaginary part defined by the second wave.
